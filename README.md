## Features

- **Self-Curing Reinforcement Learning Agents**: Agents that adapt and improve their performance over time.
- **Curiosity-Driven Exploration**: Techniques to enhance exploration strategies in RL.
- **Model-Based Reinforcement Learning**: Implementations of model-based approaches for improved learning efficiency.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: A collection of state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Installation

To install the required packages, create a virtual environment and use the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv rl-env
# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
rl-env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source rl-env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here are some quick examples to get you started:

### Training a Self-Curing RL Agent

```python
from rl_module import RLEnvironment
from self_curing_rl import SelfCuringRLAgent

env = RLEnvironment("CartPole-v1")
agent = SelfCuringRLAgent(features=[64, 64], action_dim=env.action_space.n)

# Train the agent
training_info = agent.train(env, num_episodes=1000, max_steps=500)
print(f"Final reward: {training_info['final_reward']}")
```

### Diagnosing and Healing the Agent

```python
# Simulate performance degradation
agent.performance = 0.7

# Diagnose and heal
issues = agent.diagnose()
if issues:
    print(f"Detected issues: {issues}")
    agent.heal(env, num_episodes=500, max_steps=500)
    print(f"Healing completed. New performance: {agent.performance}")
```
